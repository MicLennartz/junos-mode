# Mode for JunOS configuration files

This features `junos-mode` a mode for editing JunOS-like files.

There is currently no configuration knob.

## Integration with Babel

It also comes with an integration with Babel. This integration is
quite basic and will send a configuration to the host and provide
output of `commit check` and `show | diff`. There is no support for
session. An inferior process is run for each provided host and will
not be killed automatically.

For example:

    #+BEGIN_SRC junos :host alfred.exoscale.local
    routing-instances {
        FW-CLOUD {
            routing-options {
                static {
                    route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 192.0.2.1;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    #+END_SRC
    
    #+RESULTS:
    #+begin_example
    Load replace output:
    ————————————————————
    [Type ^D at a new line to end input]
    load complete
    
    Differences:
    ————————————
    show | diff 
    [edit routing-instances FW-CLOUD routing-options static]
           route 192.0.2.40/32 { ... }
    +      route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 192.0.2.1;
    
    Checks:
    ———————
    commit check 
    configuration check succeeds
    
    #+end_example
